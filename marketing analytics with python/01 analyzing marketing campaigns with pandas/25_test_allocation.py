'''
INTRODUCTION:
Test allocation
The email portion of this campaign was actually run as an A/B test. Half the emails sent out were generic upsells to your product
while the other half contained personalized messaging around the usersâ€™ usage of the site.

Before you begin analyzing the results, you will check to ensure users were allocated equally to the test and control groups.


INTRUCTION:
Isolate the rows of marketing where the 'marketing_channel' is 'Email' and store the results in email.
Group marketing by variant and sum the unique users and store the results in alloc.
Plot the results of alloc in a bar chart.
'''

# Subset the DataFrame
email = marketing[marketing['marketing_channel'] == 'Email']

# Group the email DataFrame by variant
alloc = email.groupby('variant')['user_id'].nunique()

# Plot a bar chart of the test allocation
alloc.plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Personalization test allocation')
plt.ylabel('# participants')
plt.show()
